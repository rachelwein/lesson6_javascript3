### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The document object model represents the web page displayed in a browser and contains all web page elements. DOM is an example of an application programming interface. 
2. The dynamic HTML is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interaction can change content of a web page without reloading. 
3. In order to access elements by name the getElementsByName() method returns the node list or HTML collection of elements with a name attribute matching a specific value.
